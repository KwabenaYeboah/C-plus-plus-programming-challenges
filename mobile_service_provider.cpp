Mobile Service Provider
A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for
its customers:
Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional
minutes are $0.45 per minute.
Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional
minutes are $0.40 per minute.
Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask
which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used.
It should then display the total amount due.
Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C.

Mobile Service Provider, Part 2
Modify the Program in Programming Challenge 25 so that it also displays how much
money Package A customers would save if they purchased packages B or C, and how
much money Package B customers would save if they purchased Package C. If there
would be no savings, no message should be printed.
